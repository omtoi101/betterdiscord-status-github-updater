# betterdiscord-status-github-updater
a simple low effort script that i threw together in 10 minutes to automatically update your better discord status with your latest github repo.
## requirements
must have 2nd button enabled in AutoStartRichPresence
python3
AutoStartRichPresence set up
probably best to have decent python knowledge
know how AutoStartRichPresence works
probably best to have basic json knowledge


### I recomend that you compile it to an exe or change it over to a pyw file and stick it in shell:startup so you dont have to handle any of it!
